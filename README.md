# TidyTuesday Repository

This repository contains my personal projects and exercises derived from the TidyTuesday initiative. Each week, I tackle a new dataset, applying techniques and methods from the `tidyverse` to explore, analyze, and visualize the data. This ongoing project serves as a practical diary of my learning journey in data science and R programming. Specifically, I want to:

- **Enhance proficiency** in using `ggplot2` for data visualization.
- **Practice manipulating data** with `tidyr` and `dplyr`.
- **Explore various real-world datasets** to understand complex data analysis scenarios.
- **Develop a portfolio** of data projects to demonstrate skills and creativity.


## About TidyTuesday
[TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) is a weekly social data project in the R community, focusing on the use of tools within the `tidyverse` ecosystem. The goal is to improve and showcase data handling and visualization skills by learning from real-world datasets.

Here, I discuss the specifics of my approach to each TidyTuesday challenge, offering a deeper dive into the use of `tidyverse` tools in a real-world context.
