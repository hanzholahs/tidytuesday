# TidyTuesday Repository

[#TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) is a weekly data project aimed at the R ecosystem to help practice using `ggplot2`, `tidyr`, `dplyr`, and other tools in the `tidyverse` ecosystem for analysis and visualisation of data. This repository contains my work in learning how to work with data as well as familiarise myself with the tools provided within `tidyverse`. 

To see how I approach `#TidyTuesday` to build my skills in using R for analysing and visualising data, you can refer to my [personal blog](https://hanzholahs.quarto.pub/blog.html#category=Tidy%20Tuesday).
